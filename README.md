## Angular Chips

The Chips in angular material are used to represent or show information, make selections, filter content, and enter data. For creating Chips we use the <mat-chip> directive.

There are 3 interaction patterns associated with chips. They are

    i) Listbox: <mat-chip-listbox> and <mat-chip-option> are used to implement a listbox accessibility pattern which provides a set of user-selectable options.

    ii) Text Entry: <mat-chip-grid> and <mat-chip-row> are used to implement a grid accessibility pattern which can be used as part of a free-form input that allows users to enter text to add chips.


    iii) Static Content: <mat-chip-set> and <mat-chip> are used as an unordered list which provides a list of items that are not interactive. This interaction pattern mimics using ul and li elements.

## Key points

Using angular chips 'Options Selections' and 'User Input Search' has made quite easier. The usage of multiple form materials
have reduced.

## Angular Chips Improvements

The Angular chips feature has many benefits, but also it requires some improvements in some circumstances. It requires some performance enhancements for dynamic chips generation and Customization according to the user needs. If these queries got addressed then there is no doubt the it makes a drastic change in user inputs using angular.

## Focus points 

We focused on developing a custom chips that can be integrated with User defined themes. In this custom chips we can customize the design of the chips using css. A library has been created for creating a custom design. By importing the custom library we can customize the theme of the chips using normal css properties.

## Conclusion

Every problem can be solved as a step by step method. On account of this, we have initiated a step for solving angular
chips theme customization. We have included this custom library and checked the output for realtime solutions. We're
very glad in finding these kinds of technical solutions that solves business queries. The further solutions will the queries
in the future and coming all the way.
